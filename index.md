## About the course


**Instructor**: <a href = "https://elevien.github.io/"> Ethan Levien</a>.

**Meeting time**: T/TH @ 10-12

**Office Hours**: TBD

**Prerequisites**: Solid undergraduate education in applied mathematics


**Course description**:  This a "journal club" style course where goal is to provide students with guided practice navigating the scientific literature. This includes reading papers, but also the process of finding articles relevant to one's research goals and formulating research questions based on a reading.
Class time will be spent on student presentations and discussions of articles.
This iteration of Math 166 will be based around the theme "What can we learn from noise? Statistical modeling of complex systems". This theme is sufficiently generally to cover topics that are of interest to most applied mathematics students, but will help facilitate some cohesion. Topics include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
  <li> Developing probabilistic models of biological, physical and social systems </li>
  <li> Machine learning from a statistical physics perspective </li>
  <li> Fundamental questions in stochastic processes and random matrix theory </li>
</ul>


## Course policies

**Attendence**: The course meets twice a week and attendance is mandatory.

**Grading**:
 Your grade will be based on the following assignments [SUBJECT TO CHANGE DEPENDING ON ENROLLMENT]:
  <ul>
    <li> Paper summary (40%) </li>
    <li> Paper presentations (30%)   </li>
    <li> Attendance and participation (30%)   </li>
  </ul>
  Grades will be based on a combination of self-evaluation and my own assessment (more on this in class).


## Assignments

**Paper reading and summary**

Outside of class, you will select at least one paper (more depending on enrollment) to read, summarize and present on in class.  Additional instructions can be found <a href = "https://elevien.github.io/math166/math166_docs/papers.pdf"> here</a>.

**Participation**

Everyone is expected to read each paper that is presented, although not in great detail. Try to come to each class with at least one question about the paper being presented.

**Presentations**

Your presentation will be a 15 minute talk. It should essentially be a summary of your report and cover all the points mentioned <a href = "https://elevien.github.io/math166/math166_docs/papers.pdf">here</a>. You can either use slides or give a "chalk talk."


## Accessibility Needs
<p> Students with disabilities who may need disability-related academic adjustments and services for this course are encouraged to see me privately as early in the term as possible. Students requiring disability- related academic adjustments and services must consult the Student Accessibility Services office (Carson Hall, Suite 125, 646-9900). Once SAS has authorized services, students must show the originally signed SAS Services and Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to me. As a first step, if students have questions about whether they qualify to receive academic adjustments and services, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.  </p>
