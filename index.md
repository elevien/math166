## About the course


 **Instructor**: <a href = "https://elevien.github.io/"> Ethan Levien</a>.

**Meeting time**: T/TH @ 10-12

**Office Hours**: TBD

 **Prerequisites**: Solid undergraduate education in applied mathematics

 **Course objectives**: The goal of this course is to provide students with guided practice navigating the scientific and mathematical liturature. The course will be based around the theme bridging microscopic and macroscopic models
During class, students will present and discuss papers or textbook chapters.

## Course policies

**Attendence**: The course meets twice a week and attendance is mandatory.

**Grading**:
 Your grade will be based on the following assignments (SUBJECT TO CHANGE DEPENDING ON ENROLLMENT):
  <ul>
    <li> Paper summary (40%) </li>
    <li> Paper presentations (30%)   </li>
    <li> Attendence and participation (30%)   </li>
  </ul>
  Grades will be based on a combination of self-evaluation and my own assessment (more on this in class).



## Assignments

**Selecting a paper**



<a href = "https://elevien.github.io/"> Here</a> is a list of exciting papers to get you started. If you are a first year graduate student, I highly enourage you to select a paper that is well established. That is, a paper that has been heavily cited. These are usually the best entry point into the litutature.

How we read a paper depends heavily why we are reading it. In some cases, we may approach a paper with the goal of extracting a particular technique or method. In other cases, we might be trying to get some context for a topic we are researching, e.g. some background on a biological system motivating a model that is of mathematical interest. Before reading a paper, I'd like you to write a brief description of your intention; that is, what you seek to extract from the paper.

**Reading of papers**

Here is a rough guide for reading scientific papers. Full disclosure: I've never used this myself expcliclty, but it does seem to follow how I approach reading papers.

<ol>
<li> **Initial reading** In an initial reading of a scientific text it can be easy to get hung up on things we don't understand. I enourage you to do an initial reading through the entire paper, and if something doesn't make sense in a couple minutes, simply mark it as such and move in. After an initial reading, you'll have a better sense for the bigger picture and what points earlier in the paper may be worth diving into. We often find that papers have many technical points which are irrelevent to our intentions or the results.
After the first reading, try to summarize the results on a conceptual level in your own words. </li>
<li> **Deep dive into key** Now return to the paper for a second reading in which you determine what technical points you need to understand to arrive at the results. Pick at least one of these and really dive into them. You likely won't be ablet to dive deeply into EVERY technical detail, but that's okay. This may involve one or more of the following:
<ul>
  <li> Writing code to run a simple simulation described in the paper.  </li>
  <li> Learning the mathematical background needed to understand a paper. For example, if Hamilton-Jacobi equations are essential in order to understand the results in your paper, you could read a chapter of a textbook on Hamilton-Jacobi equations.  </li>
  <li> Filling in the gaps in a calculation. Most papers in applied mathematics (espcially those written physicists) do not include every step in any calculation. Filling in the missing steps is a great way to test whether you actually understand whats going on. </li>
</ul> </li>
<li> **Connect to big picture** Connect the technical things you've done to the big ideas of the paper. How has your understanding of the results changed since learning more detials? What questions do you have that are not contained in the paper? What steps might you take to answer those questions?
<li> **Reflect**  What questions do you have that are not contained in the paper? What steps might you take to answer those questions? Did you get what you needed from this paper? 
</ol>






**Report**

Your report will be a 3-5 page write up of your experience reading the paper. It is not a summary of the results in the paper (although it should include an overview), but rather a documentation of you understanding. In it, you should answer the questions:
 <ul>
   <li>  Why did you select this paper?   </li>
   <li>  What was the authors motivation to write this paper? </li>
   <li>  What things did you initially not understand? </li>
   <li>  What have you done to develop the necessiry background to read the paper? </li>
   <li>  What are the next step you would take?  </li>
 </ul>

**Presentations**

Your presentation will be a 15 minute talk. It should essentially be a summary of your report and cover all the points above. You can either use slides or give a "chalk talk."







## Accessibility Needs
<p> Students with disabilities who may need disability-related academic adjustments and services for this course are encouraged to see me privately as early in the term as possible. Students requiring disability- related academic adjustments and services must consult the Student Accessibility Services office (Carson Hall, Suite 125, 646-9900). Once SAS has authorized services, students must show the originally signed SAS Services and Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to me. As a first step, if students have questions about whether they qualify to receive academic adjustments and services, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.  </p>
